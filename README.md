# Robust expansion of phylogeny for fast-growing genome sequence data

TIPars is JAVA program to do fast and accurate insertion or placement of new samples onto 
a reference phylogenetic tree based on parsimony criterion and utilized the pre-computed ancestral sequences. 
It is reliable for phylogenies comprise both densely sampled sequences (very short tree branches), e.g. SARS-CoV-2 genomes and Influenza viruses,
and divergent sequences (long tree branches), e.g. bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA sequences and Newcastle disease virus. 
It uses BEAST library [^1] and requires taxa sequences, the reference tree, 
and ancestral sequences of all its internal nodes as input data. 
Reference tree is maintained unchanged (except that a new branch added) in the insertion process. 
TIPars can do insertion of single or multiple new sequences with Newick format tree file as output, 
but can also obtain phylogenetic placement of the query sequences by generating Jplace format file [^2] for other downstream analyses. 

If there is any question about using TIPars, please send email to tipars@d24h.hk.

# How It Works 

Given the multiple sequence alignments of taxa and ancestral sequences for an existing reference phylogenetic tree, 
TIPars computes the substitution scores of the query sequence against all branches in the tree using a specific substitution scoring table based on the IUPAC nucleotide ambiguity codes 
and searches for the minimal branch as the best insertion position. Length of new branches will be recalculated based on 
a local estimation model. An example of a single query sequence is illustrated in Figure 1. 
In case where multiple branches will result into the same minimal substitution score, 
TIPars applies simple yet practical rules to filter them. For details of the algorithm, 
please refer to our preprint of this work ([link](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.30.474610v1)).
For the required input data ancestral sequence reconstruction would be done using an in-house 
script with PastML [^3] ([link](https://github.com/id-bioinfo/TIPars/tree/master/reconstrcutAncestralSeq)).
Other methods such as ML joint or marginal methods (such as those available in HYPHY [^4]) 
are also acceptable. TIPars accepts both Fasta and Vcf file formats for input sequences. 
To convert a Fasta file to a Vcf file, it is suggested to use a Python package PoMo/FastaToVCF.py [^5] ([link](https://github.com/pomo-dev/PoMo/blob/master/scripts/FastaToVCF.py)).

    - output `jplace` tree file that incorporates original tree with placement information
    - mainly for query sequence(s) classification
    - independent placement

# Benchmark datasets

The benchmark datasets used for this study can be referred on the folder `Benchmark datasets`([link](https://github.com/id-bioinfo/TIPars/tree/master/Benchmark%20datasets)),
including 16S, H3N2, NDV, SARS2-100k and SARS2-660k. Both the tree file and alignment files of taxa and ancestral sequences are available except SARS-CoV-2 datasets.
Due to GISAID's data sharing policy, only Accession Numbers are provided for the sequences downloaded from GISAID.
For the reference tree of SARS2-660k, please refer to the phylogeny (dated on 6 September 2021) under Audacity from GISAID.
